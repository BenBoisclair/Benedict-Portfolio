# Benedict-Portfolio

Hello, this is my first ever project on GitHub. It's also my first project that will be public because it's my Website Portfolio. I will be using this
website to kickstart my computer science career and hopefully get job offers!

I made this website using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and TailwindCSS.

At the moment of writing this, the website's portfolio only has 1 project which is itself but hopefully I will be able to populate the page with even more.
My goal is to become a fullstack developer and I'm starting off by focusing on front end but will slowly learn more about Python while developing my skills
in Javascript and REACT.

My name is Benedit Boisclair, and I am currently in Year 2 of Chulalongkorn University. I'm taking a startup degree and my dream is to become a CTO of my
very own company. If you ask me how far I want to take my computer science dream to, I hope to be able to write full on machine learning algorithms to
solve issues in the world and one day use a quantum computer.

Here is the website fully hosted with a domain: benedict-boisclair.com
